📌 **Overview**

This project analyzes the economic impact of the Russia–Ukraine conflict on the global defense industry by extracting, cleaning, and modeling financial and defense-related data. The aim is to quantify trends in defense spending, industry performance, and market response to geopolitical risk. The workflow integrates data engineering with analytical modeling and visualization to derive meaningful insights from macroeconomic signals.


📂 **Data Sources & Preparation**

* Financial and defense market data sourced from WRDS and other open datasets
* Data extraction using Python libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy**
* Data harmonization through merging datasets, handling missing values, and transformation logic
* Creation of derived indicators to capture changes in defense sector performance
* Preparation of analytical datasets for statistical modeling and visualization


🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The analysis phase includes:

* Summary statistics across periods before and after the conflict
* Time-series trends in defense company revenue, stock prices, and defense budgets
* Cross-section comparisons among top defense manufacturers
* Visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to highlight structural shifts


📊 **Statistical Modeling & Analysis**

* Application of **Statsmodels** for regression and trend analysis
* Evaluation of relationships between geopolitical events and financial indicators
* Interpretation of significant coefficients to understand sector sensitivities

This approach helps assess whether defense industry performance correlates with war-related economic pressure and increased global demand for military hardware. ([Peoples Democracy][1])


📈 **Results & Insights**

Key insights from the analysis show:

* Shifts in defense spending and stock performance among major arms producers
* Evidence of elevated demand for defense products in response to ongoing conflict
* Structural patterns that help contextualize how defense markets react to geopolitical risk

These results support data-driven understanding of how large-scale conflicts influence economic activity in critical industries. ([Peoples Democracy][1])
